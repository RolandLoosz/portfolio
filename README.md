# Portfolio

This website is my personal portfolio page.
I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap5.

(The page is not done yet.)

(Not deployed)

To view the page you have to download the bootstrap library to your computer.

Type `npm install bootstrap` to download it.

After the installation you can open it via a supported browser.
