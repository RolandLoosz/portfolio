# Portfolio

This website is my personal portfolio page.
I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap5.

(The page is not done yet.)

(Not deployed)

To view the page you have to download the bootstrap library to your computer.

1. Head to the root directory (where you can see index.html)
2. Type `npm install bootstrap` to download bootstrap. (You need NodeJS for Node Package Manager (npm))


After the installation you can open it via a supported browser.
